<p class="first">Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> is a dramatic representation of the treachery of political ambition and how it can lead to madness. General Macbeth, after a victorious battle, is prophesised by witches to become king. However the prophecy predicts his friend Banquo’s lineage as his successors.</p>

<p class="second">Influenced by his wife, he murders Duncan, the King of Scotland, and ascends to the throne. Fearing that Banquo suspects him, he orders Banquo to be killed in the forest, but his son Fleance escapes. The witches warn him against Macduff, the thane of Fife. He orders the killing of Macduff and his family however Macduff isn’t present. Meanwhile his wife becomes insane with guilt and dies.</p>

<p class="third">In revenge, Macduff and Duncan’s son Malcolm wage war on Macbeth, killing him in battle. Malcolm is crowned king.</p>
